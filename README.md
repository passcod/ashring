# Sherman

___NOT FOR CRITICAL USE___ This started as a toy project and grew a bit. I do
not know as much about cryptography as I should. There are probably glaring
flaws in the design and/or implementation that I have completely overlooked.
At this stage, and until it has been checked by security folks, Sherman may: be
succeptible to obvious attacks, not keep your data safe, eat your data,
self-destruct, trash your laundry, steal your lunch money, and otherwise be
unreliable for serious use. You have been warned.
